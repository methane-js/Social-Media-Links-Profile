### What I learned

It is basically a simple project. So there is nothing special.

```css
body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

I learned from youtube videos. I watched and completed some playlists of some programmers in YouTube. It was a very basic challenge and so this didn't force me to take any help from the internet
